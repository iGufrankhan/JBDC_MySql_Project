- **Creating a database**
- **Creating a table**
- **Performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations**

  - **Read**: Retrieve data from the table.
  - **Update**: Update existing data in the table.
  - **Delete**: Delete data from the table.
- **Drop Table**: Drop a table from the database.
- **Truncate Table**: Truncate (delete all data) from a table while keeping its structure.
- **Drop Database**: Drop the database.
